This example demonstrates the use of a header file to contain the
method prototypes.

This example does not actually use make or automake.  It assumes you
will use standard command line calls to compile.  Here is the command:
  gcc -o example example1.c example2.c main.c

Which will compile main.c, example1.c, example2.c and link them all into
the executable "example".  You must pass the names of all .c files to
the gcc command, as main.c no longer refers directly to the other .c
files but instead points at the header file example.h.

To run the executable, type:
  ./example

Which should produce the output:
  Hello, World 1
  Hello, World 2
