This example demonstrates use of autoconf and automake with the source
in a subdirectory.  Run these commands to compile:
  aclocal
  autoconf
  automake -a
  ./configure
  make

Which will compile main.c, example1.c, example2.c and link them all into
the executable "example".

Automake generates a Makefile based on developer-supplied information
provided in configure.ac and Makefile.am.
  configure.ac -> provides program name, version, author
  Makefile.am  -> list of files to compile and the executable to create

To run the executable, type:
  ./example

Which should produce the output:
  Hello, World 1
  Hello, World 2
