This example demonstrates how to make a library.  Run these commands to 
compile:
  libtoolize
  aclocal
  autoconf
  automake -a
  ./configure
  make
  make check

Which will:
 1) compile example1.c, example2.c and link them all into the library 
 lib/libexample.a
 2) compile main.c and link it with libexample.a into the executable
 src/example
 3) compile check_example.c and run the tests in it, with results being
 reported to stdout
