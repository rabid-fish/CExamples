This example demonstrates the use of #include to tie .c files together.

This example does not actually use make or automake.  It assumes you
will use standard command line calls to compile.  Here is the command:
  gcc -o example main.c

Which will compile main.c, example1.c, example2.c and link them all into
the executable "example".  gcc is smart about following the "#include"
statements at the top of main.c which point straight at the other c
files.

To run the executable, type:
  ./example

Which should produce the output:
  Hello, World 1
  Hello, World 2
