This example demonstrates a very simple Makefile.  Run this command to
compile:
  make

Which will compile main.c, example1.c, example2.c and link them all into
the executable "example".  The compile commands for these files are
listed out in the file "Makefile".

To run the executable, type:
  ./example

Which should produce the output:
  Hello, World 1
  Hello, World 2
