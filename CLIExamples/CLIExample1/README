Let's write a program that allows us to manage our time.  One would 
think this could be simple and straightforward, but we've got some
aims along the way that should make it interesting:
 - allow command line input
 - track data via structs
 - unit test coverage for everything non ui related
 - figure out how to create an API we can reuse later
 - learn how to manage strings

This is all very beginner stuff, which is my skill level at this point
anyways.

The data structures:

 activity
 - activity_id
 - description
 - keywords
 
 activity_x
 - parent_activity_id
 - child_activity_id
 - child_activity_order

 keyword
 - keyword_id
 - description

 keyword_x
 - keyword_id
 - activity_id
 - order

There will always be a parent "activity" with id of 0 that all other
activities will stem from.

Api Calls (tm is short for "Time Manager"):

  tm_activity_create
  tm_activity_read
  tm_activity_update
  tm_activity_delete

  tm_activity_join
  
  tm_keyword_create
  tm_keyword_read
  tm_keyword_update
  tm_keyword_delete
  
  tm_keyword_join
